            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Founded by the kind and steadfast Helga Hufflepuff, this house values loyalty, fairness, and unshakable dedication. Hufflepuffs are known for their unwavering work ethic, deep sense of justice, and the quiet strength they bring to all they do. While other houses sought students with specific traits, Helga Hufflepuff declared she would teach all those who desired to learn — welcoming students of every kind with open arms.

Hufflepuff House is often underestimated, but it has produced witches and wizards of remarkable talent and heart. Its members are the most inclusive of all, priding themselves on friendship, honesty, and teamwork rather than ambition or glory. Their quiet resilience makes them the true backbone of the magical world.

The emblematic animal of the house is the badger — gentle yet fierce when provoked. Its colors are yellow and black, representing warmth, loyalty, and strength beneath the surface.</p>

            <h2>The Common Room</h2>
            <p>Tucked away near the kitchens on the basement level of Hogwarts, the Hufflepuff Common Room is a warm and welcoming sanctuary — much like the students who call it home. To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row, in the rhythm of “Helga Hufflepuff.” Get it wrong, and you’ll be doused in vinegar — a gentle warning wrapped in house tradition.

Once inside, the room glows with sunlight streaming through circular windows that peek out into the grass and earth, giving the space a natural, cozy feeling. The room is filled with low-ceilinged tunnels, round doors, and plenty of earthy textures. Decorated in warm yellows, soft browns, and with overstuffed chairs, copper kettles, and plants that flourish with quiet magic, the space feels more like a home than a hall of study.

Unlike other houses, Hufflepuff's common room is known for its cheer, comfort, and complete lack of elitism. Here, everyone has a seat by the fire and a voice in the room. It reflects the values Helga Hufflepuff held dear — warmth, kindness, and community above all else.</p>
