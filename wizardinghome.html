            <h2>The Founding of Hogwarts: A Legacy Woven in Magic</h2>
            <p>Over a millennium ago, in an age when magic was feared by the non-magical and the shadows of suspicion loomed over gifted children, four of the greatest witches and wizards of the era united under a shared vision—to create a sanctuary of learning for the magically inclined. Thus, deep within the Scottish Highlands, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was born.
              The founders—Godric Gryffindor, brave and noble; Rowena Ravenclaw, wise and sharp of mind; Helga Hufflepuff, kind-hearted and just; and Salazar Slytherin, ambitious and cunning—each imbued the school with their values and ideals. They conjured its very walls with enchantments, hid it from Muggle eyes, and filled its halls with magic older than memory.
              From these four, the Houses were formed—each a reflection of its founder’s heart. Students were sorted by traits admired most: valor, wit, loyalty, or ambition. But unity was not to last. A rift tore through the founders, sparked by Slytherin’s insistence on magical purity. Unable to reconcile, he left the school, yet not without leaving behind secrets—some buried deep within the castle's walls.
              Despite this division, the school endured. Its sentient staircases, whispering portraits, forbidden forest, and ever-changing rooms turned it into a place of wonder and challenge—a crucible where young witches and wizards would be shaped by history, destiny, and their own choices.
              To this day, Hogwarts stands not only as a school, but as a living monument to an ancient pact—one of magic, knowledge, and the belief that greatness can rise from anyone, no matter their bloodline.

                <h3>Great Hall</h3>
                <p>The heart of the castle where all Houses gather for meals and important announcements. 
                    With its bewitched ceiling that reflects the sky outside, the Great Hall is a place of unity, celebration, 
                    and sometimes confrontation.</p>

                <h3>Library</h3>
                <p>A vast and ancient collection of magical knowledge. 
                    From basic spellbooks to restricted tomes of dark magic, 
                    the library holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>

                <h3>Room of Requirement</h3>
                <p>A mysterious space that appears only when someone is in great need.
                    It transforms into whatever the seeker requires—from a hidden training ground to a safe refuge.</p>

                <h3>Dungeons</h3>
                <p>Dark and damp, the dungeons house Potions class and some of the oldest, untouched corners of Hogwarts.</p>

                <h3>The Grand Staircase</h3>
                <p>A moving, twisting network of stairs that rarely lead the same way twice.
                    It confounds new students but becomes second nature to Hogwarts dwellers.</p>

                <h3>The Kitchens</h3>
                <p>Hidden behind a painting of a fruit bowl, the kitchens are operated by loyal house-elves who ensure every feast is magical and abundant.</p>

                <h3>Hospital Wing</h3>
                <p>Run by Madam Pomfrey, it’s a place of miraculous healing and magical remedies, 
                    essential in a school where dangerous charms and rogue bludgers are commonplace.</p>

                <h3>The Whomping Willow</h3>
                <p>Planted on the Hogwarts grounds in the early 1970s, the Whomping Willow is no ordinary tree. This magical and highly aggressive plant will strike anything—or anyone—that comes too close. But it wasn’t planted simply to ward off nosy students. It conceals the secret entrance to a tunnel leading to the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade.</p>

                <h3>Forbidden Forest</h3>
                <p>Just beyond the grounds lies the dark, creature-filled forest that students are warned to avoid—though it becomes a place of secrets, trials, and sometimes sanctuary.</p>

                <h3>The Lake</h3>
