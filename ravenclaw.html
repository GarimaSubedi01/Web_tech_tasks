            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ravenclaw House is a haven for those with sharp minds, boundless curiosity, and a thirst for knowledge. Founded by the wise and brilliant Rowena Ravenclaw, this house prizes intellect, wit, and wisdom above all. Its members are known for their originality and independent thinking, often approaching problems with unique and creative solutions. Ravenclaws are seekers of truth, delving deep into learning not just for grades, but for the sheer love of understanding the world.
                The emblematic animal of Ravenclaw is the eagle—soaring high and seeing far—symbolizing the vision and ambition of its students. Clad in house colors of blue and bronze, Ravenclaws reside in a lofty tower, accessible only to those who can solve a riddle to enter. For Ravenclaws, learning is not a task—it’s a lifelong adventure.</p>

            <h2>The Common Room</h2>
            <p>The Ravenclaw common room is perched at the top of a spiraling tower on the west side of Hogwarts Castle, offering one of the most breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and lake. To enter, students must answer a riddle posed by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker, a fitting test for a house that prizes wit and intellect. Inside, the room is airy and circular, with arched windows that let in streams of natural light and a domed ceiling painted with stars. Elegant bookcases line the walls, and midnight blue silks hang gracefully, reflecting the calm and thoughtful nature of the house. A statue of Rowena Ravenclaw stands tall and graceful in the corner, watching over her students with pride. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative—a perfect place for study, reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
