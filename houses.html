            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>At the heart of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry lies a timeless tradition—the Sorting of students into one 
                of the four legendary houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Each house, founded by one of the original four
                 founders of Hogwarts, values unique traits and nurtures students according to its guiding principles. 
                Together, they form the soul of the castle, shaping friendships, rivalries, and a deep sense of belonging. 
                From shared dormitories and house points to Quidditch matches and common rooms, the house system defines much of student life at Hogwarts. Though each house is distinct, 
                they are all part of the same magical family, where courage, wisdom, loyalty, and ambition thrive side by side.</p>

            <h2>The Sorting Hat</h2>
            <p>The Sorting Hat is no ordinary hat—it is a sentient, magical relic imbued with the wisdom of the four founders themselves. Every year, during the Sorting Ceremony, it is placed upon the head of each new student, delving deep into their mind and heart to determine where they truly belong. With a raspy voice and ancient insight, the Sorting Hat evaluates each student's traits, desires, and potential, ultimately placing them into Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin. While some Sortings are swift, others provoke moments of inner debate, where the hat considers more than one house before deciding. 
               Trusted and revered, the Sorting Hat ensures that every witch and wizard finds not just a place, but a home within Hogwarts’ hallowed halls.</p>
