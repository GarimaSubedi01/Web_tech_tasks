            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gryffindor House is one of the four legendary houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by the brave and noble Godric Gryffindor. Known for valuing courage, daring, determination, and chivalry, Gryffindor is home to those who possess a bold heart and a strong moral compass.

The house emblem is a lion, symbolizing bravery and strength, and its colors—scarlet and gold—reflect the fiery spirit and loyalty of its members. The common room, located in Gryffindor Tower, is warm and inviting, filled with squashy armchairs, a roaring fireplace, and walls draped in crimson and gold tapestries.

Gryffindor has produced some of the most renowned witches and wizards in magical history, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Albus Dumbledore. It stands as a beacon of heroism, often leading the charge in the face of darkness and injustice.

To be a Gryffindor is to walk a path of fearless resolve, standing tall even when fear looms large. For those who value honor over ease and choose what is right over what is easy, Gryffindor is home.</p>

            <h2>The Common Room</h2>
            <p>The Gryffindor common room is a cozy, inviting space perched high in Gryffindor Tower, behind the portrait of the Fat Lady. It’s filled with deep red and gold hues, with walls adorned in tapestries and banners bearing the house emblem—a proud lion. The room is lit by a large fireplace that crackles warmly, casting a golden glow across the armchairs and wooden tables where students study, chat, and relax. Large, arched windows offer a stunning view of the Hogwarts grounds, and the atmosphere always feels bold and alive, reflecting the courageous spirit of Gryffindor House.</p>
