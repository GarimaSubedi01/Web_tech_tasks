            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Founded by Salazar Slytherin, this house values students who are cunning, determined, and driven by purpose. Its emblematic animal, the serpent, symbolizes transformation and intelligence, while the house colors — green and silver — echo the depths of the Black Lake and the shine of pure determination.

Slytherins are often natural leaders, unafraid to carve their own path and seize the opportunities others might hesitate to pursue. With a reputation for producing some of the wizarding world's most influential figures, both celebrated and feared, Slytherin encourages strategic thinking and perseverance. Its common room, nestled beneath the lake in the dungeons, is cool, mysterious, and grand — reflecting the house’s elegant strength.

Here in Slytherin, greatness is not given — it is earned.</p>

            <h2>The Common Room</h2>
            <p>Hidden deep beneath the Black Lake, the Slytherin common room is as secretive and enchanting as the house itself. Carved into the dungeons of Hogwarts, it exudes an eerie beauty — lit by the green glow of lake water shimmering against the stone walls. The room is long, low, and grand, with dark wooden furnishings, leather chairs, and greenish lamps casting flickering shadows across the stone floor.

The atmosphere is cool and hushed, offering privacy and stillness — a place for ambition to simmer and plans to be made. Serpentine carvings and silver accents adorn the space, reflecting the pride of its inhabitants in their heritage and lineage. Here, Slytherins gather not just to rest, but to refine their goals, share clever ideas, and quietly shape their destinies.

The entrance is concealed behind a stretch of bare stone wall, only opening when a specific password — often in Parseltongue — is spoken.
